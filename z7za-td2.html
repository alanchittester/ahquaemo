Now I have to spend 20 minutes a day cleaning house which is no easy task since I need a lot of my loot for recalibration. Why a limit to stash space? Why do we have less backpack space than we did in TD1? edit: Thanks for the gold! Clearly this is a ubiquitous issue that hinders gameplay for most, at least if you play as much as I do. Hopefully UbiMass Итак случилось то чего мы владельцы HTC TD2 ждали уже 20 дней, с момента выхода Windows Phone 6.5, все заявленные аппараты HTC получили свой апдейт прошивки, однако TD2 остался I'm a little bored with the game, a surprise to me since I played TD1 since launch all the way through it's life span. So while we are waiting for the big changes next patch, what are you doing to keep yourselves invested? Also any tips for inventory management? It's a big deterrent for me right.

I guess the title is rather self-explanatory but I'm happy to dive a bit deeper into things. Basically the inventory management is one of the main reasons why I stopped playing this game for now. At best it's tedious and boring, at worst it's flat out frustrating, and I just can't be bothered anymore to work around this, sorting my loot for 20 minutes deciding which item from the stash needs to go in order to make space for a new one, and so on - I'm sure we've all been at that point. ampnbs.

( Old thread. (https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b2h4mn/nasty_dx12_crashes_which_locks_the_whole_pc_after/)´) gtWhen playing with DX12 , I experience CTD's after a certain amount of time. Since I'm eager to find the reason for them, I've looked up some stuff (IT tech engineer here). gt gtDuring the crashes, the Nvidia Container Service peaked the GPU (2080Ti, newest driver) to around 60% without. See you guys in The Division 2 (for now). You know it's doomed when all the subreddit is talking about is the lack of loot. Either fix your game, or people will just drop your 6 year old game for one that was developed in 2, that has arguably MORE content and MORE loot. Oh, and the endgame has raids, 5 World Tiers, and a revamped mission system post story. I'm over it. Sorry devs. I really tried to like this game. I really did. Spent a lot of time grinding only to get frustrated over the repeti. I’ll be brief here, I love the game, play every day. But the thing i miss most is recognising and adjusting based on what i see my group doing. I miss grouping up outside a mission, while next to me a guy has his 10k Reclaimer box down for all to see. “I’m the healer!” I miss someone kicking off the first firefight with a super-bastard flame turret and incendiary seeker mines to burn the shit out of everything. (Ooh, dudes rocking Firecrest) I miss the madman with the souped up Riot Shield. The aesthetic of snowy New York City in the middle of winter with all of the blizzards and snow storms just cannot be beat. I do love the new setting but I would absolutely poop my pants if they did a seasonal event during Christmas 2019 and had the whole map covered 
So i was what people call the "top 1%" and "git gud'er" in TD1. I some periods i would play for around 12 hours a day, and on an average workday i would probably play around 5-6 hours at least. Needless to say TD1 was my favourite game, in fact it was the game that started my small streaming endavours (i still stream the division to this day). amp#x200B; My favourite activity in TD1 was the dark zone, in the beggining of the game i would spend 90% of my time there, always going I received The division 1 in a bundle. Played a bit (\~30 hours) and truly liked it. I did not want to go too deep into it because TD2 was releasing soon. amp#x200B; As always I waited a few weeks to get the reviews before buying the game, especially the player review and of course this subreddit. amp#x200B; I did not wait long before the subreddit was flooded by people in adoration for Massive and their incredible masterpiece they created. I was super hyped. Then after a few weeks My wife, up until last year, had only love for games like Spyro and Tetris.  Then came Fortnite. She wanted to play with me and did competently but nothing to shout about. Then she saw that I was playing the beta for TD2 and wanted to try. At first it was cute. Getting some kills but mostly hanging in the back hiding behind cover. That was 40 hours of gameplay ago. Now we are World Tier 2, she rivals me for kills per session and doubles my headshots. This once timid woman. God motherfucking damn it, Bioware. Anthem was supposed to be amazing. I thought it was. I truly did. I stomached the loading screens, because I knew what was on the other side; the magnificent flying and explosions with my teammates. But. GOD DAMN IT. I played Div 2 for 2 hours this morning. It has completely ruined Anthem. 1) Swap weapons on the fly, PICK UP AND SWITCH WITH LOOT YOU JUST FOUND WITH ONE PUSH OF A BUTTON. 2) ZERO loading screens. Zero. Aside from game launch. As a game that has only recently launched i already feel like there is no real reason to log and play. I can't even think of a real reason to just grind for gear as the build variety is so narrow once you have a decent damage build and maybe a seeker mine build with high explosive damage and CDR there isn't allot else that is viable. I hate to say it but i finally have to admit that the game feels like its a bit of mess at the moment. Great game just nothing to really do. The longer I find it very frustrating when I am trying to re-calibrate gear or weapons and I can only change the attribute with a better version of that attribute and on top of that, each piece of gear/weapons has a cap as to how much of that attribute you can re-calibrate to. Example, if I have +150 skill power bonus, I can only re-calibrate skill power bonus and not DPS or defense and if my existing piece of gear has +50 skill power bonus and only caps at 200 skill bonus, I then lose out on the other. 
Seems like Black Tusk are in need of much money  And District Union Arena was just invaded the week before last week. P.S. Neither of the weekly projects reward blueprints , lmfao. Praise the RNG and weekly R.I.P. nemesis for those who lack the part from Capitol Building. gtCapital→Roosevelt→Arena→Roosevelt→Arena gt gtAnd another stunning fact is that the first 3 weeks seemed not being RNG. so far. Guess what's next? This reminds me the good old times waiting. We have the skills , but no set effect to really bring out their potential. I am primarily a PVE player. I enjoy some limited PVP here and there, but 99% of my focus and enjoyment is PVE. I liked TD1, but passed on it at launch because of how you were forced to PVP to get the best gear ((at launch, i guess it may have eventually changed)). I have invested about 3 weeks of playtime into TD2 only to be told that now we're forced back into the DZ. But ya know what? Im not that upset. I've actually been playing in the DZ farming pestilences to upgrade my other exotics. TL;DR - I think the essence of my point is that the issues are easily corrected, mostly very minor, and plenty of it falls into the realm of "expected, normal post launch shooter issues" like balancing and such. Why you mad bro? I hate that I'm writing this because usually I find posts like this to be kinda cringey, sometimes written by people in denial, and/or otherwise useless. Also, the length. No one will read it. The following was initially going to be a comment on another thread 
I’m not sure why the devs have gone down this route of six piece bonuses like with Classified items in the last game. The game is so much more interesting when you can mix and match gear sets, and with brands having so many talents and attributes it would only make build diversity better in the long run. I felt like the Classified items in Div 1 just lead to everyone running six pieces. Now it just seems that the gear set bonuses are so underwhelming because the devs probably didn’t https://imgur.com/gallery/Tz8ZDVz Edit: thanks for the silver you beautiful agent. Only bringing this up because I've seen a fair number of people in different TD2 communities on Social Media ask for Armor Kits to be a) Instant and b) applicable while moving. I don't think I'm alone, and I think that the armor kit mechanics are really good. I don't think the time to apply is too long, I DEFINITELY do NOT think they should instant (like medkits from TD1). The current mechanic is what drives the more tactical nature of TD2. In my unscientific observation of the folks asking. There seem to be an issue with how specifically the chest pieces, masks and face masks fit to "some" female faces/bodies. - The mask is floating in front of the mouth and is a little too big. - Chest pieces are too big and there is space between the body and the model. - The face masks "hunter type" are too big and as a result the eyes doesn't fit the view holes. I know it's not easy since we can move the mouth and eyes during char creation, but i have faith 上西研究室は、「ものづくり」における従来の「大量生産・大量消費」から、今後の「多様化」という時代の流れに順応.
